# infinite_pokemon
I found an openai [C#/.NET SDK](https://github.com/OkGoDoIt/OpenAI-API-dotnet/tree/master) and wanted to make a little project to test it out. (I found out way too late that WebGL doesn't really like system.net.http and you'd be better off using the unity web namespace if you want a webgl build)

This is a tiny little game where fake pokemon type creatures are created using a little procedural generation and the openai api. There's 5 possible types that a given pokemon can be, each having a weakness and strength against another.

When you defeat your opponent, a new one is generated and you regain your health so you can continue fighting until you're dethroned.

I was planning on expanding this so you can walk around in tall grass to find things and whatnot and maybe you have a party and infinite pokeballs and so on.

However I've had one foot out the door on Unity for a while and during this project Unity was being exceptionally fussy so immediately after writing this I'm uninstalling unity and everything associated with it and installing Godot and Bevy.

So if this project continues it will be recreated there.
